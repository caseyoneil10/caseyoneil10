I am a Software Engineer with a passion for Full-Stack Development who loves solving problems with JavaScript, React, and PostreSQL. I have 7+ years of  sales and customer service experience which have taught me the power of communicating a problem, and then also quickly and efficiently solving said problem. 

I thrive when navigating stressful, high stakes environments where my organization skills, and ability to bring levity to situations ensures that the energy of the team is not affected, and we achieve the optimum result together. 

I am looking forward to working in an environment where I can not only achieve my highest potential and contribute to solving problems, but also help others in solving problems, while elevating my team members to achieve their fullest potential.
